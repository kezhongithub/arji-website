    <h3>I'm Currently Studying at DLSJBC</h3> 
    <p>Being an IT student at De La Salle John Bosco College (DLSJBC)
      is a challenging but rewarding experience. Students have access
      to state-of-the-art facilities and resources, and they are taught
      by experienced and knowledgeable faculty. The IT program is rigorous
      and challenging, but it is designed to prepare students for successful
      careers in the rapidly growing IT industry. In addition to the core IT 
      curriculum, DLSJBC also offers a variety of electives and specializations, 
      so students can tailor their education to their specific interests and goals.
      DLSJBC IT students are highly sought-after by employers, and they graduate with the
      skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the IT industry.</p>
